Legacy systems in the automotive rental industry often suffer from inefficiency and lack of scalability. This project presents a **Car Rental Management System** built using **C++**, designed to streamline operations through Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. By encapsulating logic within `Car`, `Customer`, and `Rental` classes, the system ensures data integrity and modularity. Key features include real-time inventory tracking, bill generation, and persistent data storage using file handling.

## Modularity in Design

Why use Classes instead of just functions?

### The Analogy: The Lego Kit
*   **Procedural Code**: Is like a clay model. It's one big blob. If you want to change the tire, you have to reshape the whole side of the car.
*   **OOP (This System)**: Is like a Lego kit. The "Tire" is a separate brick (Class). The "Engine" is a separate brick. You can swap the tire without touching the engine. In our system, we can upgrade the `billing` logic without breaking the `car inventory` logic because they are separate, self-contained objects.

## System Architecture

The application is structured around three core interactions:

1.  **Inventory Management**:
    *   Uses a `std::vector<Car>` to dynamically store fleet information.
    *   Allows adding/removing vehicles during runtime.
2.  **Rental Processing**:
    *   Calculates costs based on rental duration and car model.
    *   Updates availability status automatically.
3.  **Data Persistence**:
    *   Writes all transaction logs to `.txt` files, ensuring data isn't lost when the program closes.
