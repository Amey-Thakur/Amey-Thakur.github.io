In Canada, inadequate insulation in homes leads to excessive energy use, higher expenditures, and a huge carbon impact. Ineffective insulation lets cold air penetrate and heat escape, making Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems work harder and use more energy to keep a comfortable temperature. This presents a challenge during the long, cold Canadian winters when home heating accounts for a significant portion of energy use and carbon emissions. Older or improperly placed insulation materials, such as fibreglass and mineral wool, may lose their insulating capacity due to exposure to moisture or poor installation, raising homeowners' energy bills.

One way to address rising bills issue is using more effective insulating materials, such as spray foam or blown-in cellulose. However, it's equally crucial to use eco-friendly and sustainable products. The foam insulation materials Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) and Extruded Polystyrene (XPS) may be produced using recycled resources like post-consumer plastic waste. Utilizing recycled materials reduces the environmental effect of insulation manufacture, preserves natural resources, and diverts trash from landfills.

High-quality insulating products with several advantages include EPS and XPS. Homeowners prefer high quality insulation such as EPS and XPS to save more money in long run. These materials are moisture resistant, which aids in preventing the development of mould and mildew in the house. Also, these materials are strong and long-lasting, guaranteeing that the insulation will remain effective for many years.

In addition to being good for the environment, using recycled EPS and XPS as insulation helps businesses market themselves. Offering insulation made of recycled materials may set a product apart from rivals and draw customers who care about the environment and profit from government subsidies. Government subsidies and incentives are also available to entice homeowners to convert to more energy-efficient insulation materials, such as EPS and XPS, created from recycled materials. Although EPS and XPS have many advantages, it is crucial to remember that there may still be some environmental effects from their manufacture. Toxins are used throughout production, which can pollute the environment. On the other hand, utilizing recycled materials can lessen some of these effects by lowering the demand for new plastic manufacturing.

In conclusion, improving house insulation is essential for lowering energy expenditures, cutting costs associated with energy use, and cutting carbon emissions in Canada. Another advantage of recycling EPS and XPS for insulation is that it conserves natural resources and trash. Businesses can provide eco-friendly solutions to attract customers who care about the environment and profit from government subsidies. We can contribute to a more ecologically friendly and sustainable future for Canada by prioritizing sustainability to insulation choices.

## Introduction

### Problem Description

In Canada, inefficient home insulation is a significant problem that leads to high energy consumption, increased costs, and a significant carbon footprint. The harsh Canadian winter temperatures make home heating a major contributor to energy use and carbon emissions [[1]](#ref-1). Inefficient insulation allows heat to escape and cold air to seep in, which causes HVAC systems to work harder and consume more energy to maintain a comfortable temperature. Outdated or poorly installed insulation materials, such as fibreglass and mineral wool, contribute to energy waste and climate change [[2]](#ref-2), [[3]](#ref-3). These materials can lose their insulating ability due to exposure to moisture or inadequate installation, resulting in higher heating bills for homeowners [[1]](#ref-1), [[4]](#ref-4).

### Product Description

The proposed product is an efficient home insulation system with EPS and XPS materials. It provides superior insulation against heat loss and reduces energy waste for new and existing homes. The system lowers energy bills and reduces the carbon footprint of homes in Canada. The insulation materials work together to create a long-lasting system resistant to moisture, mould, and mildew. Homeowners can enjoy a more comfortable living environment and contribute to a more sustainable future for Canada and the world [[5]](#ref-5).

{{< figure src="Efficient%20Home%20Insulation/figures/figure%201%20-%20The%20difference%20between%20EPS%20and%20XPS.png" caption="The difference between EPS and XPS [[6]](#ref-6)" align="center" >}}

### Problem Solution

Employing insulation materials such as EPS and XPS can significantly improve the insulation of homes in Canada. These materials provide superior insulation and are more resistant to moisture and air leakage than traditional insulation materials, such as fibreglass. XPS and EPS are advantageous as they can last for a century, though they differ. For example, as shown in figure 1, in contrast to EPS, which has an open-cell structure, XPS has a closed-cell structure that makes it more resistant. Thus, when exposed to moisture, XPS only loses up to 10% of its heat over a decade, while EPS loses up to 15% to 20% in parallel situations as shown in the graph below.

{{< figure src="Efficient%20Home%20Insulation/figures/figure%202%20-%20Heat%20loss%20of%20insulation%20materials%20over%20decade.png" caption="Heat loss of insulation materials over decade" align="center" >}}

Additionally, spray foam insulation made of polyurethane can help close cracks and stop air leaks, further improving insulation and energy efficiency. By using EPS, XPS, and polyurethane materials for insulation, Canadian homeowners can save on energy expenditures and heating bills while contributing to sustainability goals [[1]](#ref-1). By increasing the Thermal Resistance (R-value) and moisture resistance of insulation materials, homeowners can enjoy increased comfort and energy efficiency in both new and old homes.

Overall, using these materials presents a cost-effective and environmentally responsible solution to address the energy waste problem in Canadian homes. By providing superior insulation, the solution helps reduce the carbon footprint of homes across Canada and contributes to a more sustainable future for the country and the world [[7]](#ref-7).

### Introduction of the Four Smart Design Lenses

### Human

Efficient insulation materials such as EPS and XPS can lower heating costs and energy consumption for Canadian homeowners, aligning with the UN's SDGs. Regarding the human component of the intelligent design lenses, six key considerations should be assessed: access and feasibility, beneficiaries, accountability, impact on stakeholders, and improvement of human life.

#### Access and Feasibility

The solution includes awareness campaigns, subsidies, and installation training programs to ensure universal access to efficient home insulation. Certified installers are available across Canada, and materials such as EPS and XPS are available. However, lack of awareness, cost, and installation requirements are the main barriers to access. To address these barriers, education and outreach programs can raise awareness about the benefits of these materials and guide their installation and maintenance. Homeowners can also be incentivized to switch to these materials through tax benefits or rebates. EPS has a higher Resistance value (R-value) than fibreglass insulation, at 3.9 per inch [[13]](#ref-13), making it a more effective insulation option [[14]](#ref-14).

Regarding the technology component of the intelligent design lenses, five key considerations should be assessed: proposed technology, modifications, suitability of current technology, infrastructures for technology, and product plan for the extension.

#### Proposed Technology

The proposed insulation materials are EPS, XPS, PUF, and fibreglass. EPS provides excellent thermal insulation and is lightweight and durable. XPS is moisture-resistant, has stable thermal resistivity, and is recyclable. PUF is famous for thermal insulation due to its low thermal conductivity and outstanding mechanical properties. The thermal resistance of the material is vital when selecting the proper insulation [[21]](#ref-21).

{{< figure src="Efficient%20Home%20Insulation/figures/figure%203%20-%20Insulating%20materials%20-%20(a)%20EPS%20(b)%20XPS%20(c)%20PUF%20and%20(d)%20Fibreglass%20roll%20sheet.jpg" caption="Insulating materials: (a) EPS (b) XPS; (c) PUF; and (d) Fibreglass roll sheet [[21]](#ref-21)" align="center" >}}

#### Modifications

The intelligent design approach balances EPS, XPS, and PUF insulation materials. However, it must prioritize sustainable and recycled materials to align with nature. The proposal supports the UN's SDGs, including “SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and SDG 12” (Responsible Consumption and Production). Sustainable and recycled materials are utilized in designing the materials to reduce waste and promote responsible production [[22]](#ref-22). The materials help reduce energy waste and heating costs, providing affordable and clean energy [[1]](#ref-1). The insulation system is a sustainable solution for Canadian homes as they promote sustainable cities and communities.

#### Suitability of Current Technology

The proposal employs advanced technologies, including EPS, XPS, and PUF insulation materials, surpassing fibreglass, and mineral wool in terms of insulation and resistance to moisture and air leakage. These materials reduce energy waste, lower heating costs, and provide better insulation suitable for the Canadian climate [[1]](#ref-1).

#### Infrastructures for Technology

Canadian houses are compatible with the proposed materials. However, material utilization may require improvement due to factors such as material availability, installation costs, and technical skill requirements for installation. A lack of awareness of the solution's benefits may also challenge its adoption.

#### Product Plan for Extension

The proposed materials incorporate sustainable and recycled materials, reducing the risk of obsolescence. However, insulation technology advancements may necessitate design adjustments to maintain their effectiveness. Ongoing technical support and training for Canadian homeowners can extend the material's lifespan to 25 years, surpassing traditional fibreglass insulation, which lasts only 10-15 years. However, regular maintenance is necessary to ensure the material's longevity.

### Nature

The Canadian Home Insulation System prioritizes sustainability, reducing waste output, and lowering energy use and greenhouse gas emissions to enhance air quality and lessen climate change [[1]](#ref-1), [[12]](#ref-12), [[13]](#ref-13). Regarding the nature component of the intelligent design lenses, four key considerations should be assessed: Impact on the ecosystem, sustainability and environmental impact, projections for improvement to nature, and resource efficiency.

#### Ecosystem Impact

To minimize the environmental impact of insulation materials during production and disposal, it is crucial to use sustainable insulation materials. Traditional materials like fibreglass and foam insulation can release harmful chemicals during manufacturing [[21]](#ref-21). The proposed solution promotes the use of EPS and XPS insulation materials as they are made from recycled materials and have minimal impact on ecosystems.

{{< figure src="Efficient%20Home%20Insulation/figures/figure%204%20-%20The%20Multiple%20roles%20of%20insulation.jpg" caption="The Multiple roles of insulation [[23]](#ref-23)" align="center" >}}

#### Sustainability and Environmental Impact

To promote sustainability in the production and usage of insulation materials, EPS and XPS are highly recommended. These materials have a low embodied energy, which means they require less energy for production than other materials. They are also durable, long-lasting, and recyclable, reducing waste and environmental impact.

The use of EPS and XPS in home insulation can contribute to the SDGs promoting clean and affordable energy by reducing the energy needed to heat and cool a home. In addition, the recyclability of insulation materials promotes responsible consumption and production (SDG 12) by generating minimal waste during manufacturing. By promoting energy efficiency and reducing energy consumption, home insulation also helps mitigate climate change and contributes to (SDG 13) Climate Action [[24]](#ref-24).

#### Projection for Improvement to Nature

EPS and XPS as insulation materials can lower greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the energy needed to “heat and cool homes, improving air quality and reducing pollution” [[12]](#ref-12), [[13]](#ref-13). These materials are also recyclable, promoting sustainability and reducing environmental impact. However, their production requires energy and may contribute to greenhouse gas emissions [[12]](#ref-12), [[13]](#ref-13). Proper recycling is necessary to avoid landfill waste. Despite the materials' minimal impact on ecosystems, potential negative impacts should be considered.

#### Resource Efficiency

The sourcing of raw materials for insulation can significantly impact the environment. The production of EPS and XPS requires the use of hydrocarbons, which are sourced from non- renewable sources. However, the use of these materials in efficient home insulation can lead to long-term environmental benefits that outweigh the negative impacts of sourcing raw materials.
