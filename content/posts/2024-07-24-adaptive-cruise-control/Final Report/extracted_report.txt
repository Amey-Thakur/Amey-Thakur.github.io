Unlike traditional cruise control systems, ACC utilizes sensors and intelligent algorithms to automatically adjust a vehicle's speed and maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front, even in changing traffic conditions [1].In the past, cruise control allowed drivers to set a specific speed for their vehicles, but it lacked the ability to adapt to traffic situations. ACC changes the game by incorporating radar, lidar, and camera sensors that continuously scan the road ahead [2]. These sensors provide real-time information about the distance and speed of other vehicles, enabling the system to make informed decisions about accelerating or decelerating to match the leading vehicle's pace.The primary goal of ACC is to improve safety on the roads. By automatically adjusting the speed and maintaining a safe following distance, ACC reduces the risk of rear-end collisions, which are a common type of accident [3]. This feature also helps prevent driver fatigue by reducing the need for constant monitoring of traffic conditions.The benefits of ACC extend beyond safety. It offers a significant convenience factor, allowing drivers to enjoy the advantages of cruise control while still relying on the system to handle the changing traffic environment. ACC optimizes driving efficiency and provides a more comfortable experience, particularly in congested or variable-speed situations.ACC serves as a crucial step as the automotive industry moves towards the development of autonomous vehicles. It is part of a broader concept known as Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) and contributes to the ongoing progress of creating self-driving cars [4]./Figure 1: Adaptive Cruise Control [5]Project ObjectivesThe project aims to demonstrate the functionality and effectiveness of an ACC system through MATLAB integration and software coding. The project seeks to accomplish three following goals.Develop a control system that automatically adjusts the host vehicle's speed based on the movements of the preceding vehicle. This system will maintain a safe and comfortable following distance between the two vehicles.Apply a sensor that continuously monitors the distance between the vehicles and adjust the host vehicle's speed to avoid collisions or unsafe situations.Analyze and showcase the ACC system's response to changes in the preceding vehicle's speed. The system will promptly and smoothly adapt to changes in the preceding vehicle's speed while maintaining a safe distance and adapting to traffic conditions.By achieving these objectives, the project will provide a practical demonstration of the benefits and effectiveness of ACC in enhancing driving safety, convenience, and comfort [6].Hardware Components and ToolsHardware ComponentsLCD Display: Visual displays are used to provide real-time information and feedback to the driver, such as current speed and distance measurements [7]./Figure 2: Arduino’s LCD Interface [8]Arduino Uno: A microcontroller board serves as the central control unit for the ACC system [7].

Availability: Acquiring the necessary hardware components, such as the radar sensor or microcontroller, may pose challenges and potentially delay project progress. Efforts will be made to identify suitable alternatives or workarounds in such situations.Real-world Constraints: The performance of the control system can be influenced by real-world factors, such as variations in weather conditions, road conditions, or vehicle dynamics [19]. Simulating these constraints accurately in MATLAB may present challenges and require additional calibration.System Complexity: Developing an ACC system involves dealing with complex algorithms and the integration of multiple components. The inherent complexity of the system may lead to unexpected issues or difficulties during the implementation phase.Safety Considerations: Ensuring the safety of the ACC system is of utmost importance. By testing and validation of the control algorithm and hardware integration are necessary to mitigate any potential risks associated with incorrect speed adjustments or unreliable distance measurements [20].Time Management: Effective time management is critical for meeting project milestones. Delays in any phase of the project could impact subsequent tasks and the overall project timeline. Maintaining open communication and coordination among team members will be essential to mitigate this risk.It is essential to proactively address these limitations and risks to ensure the successful completion of the project.Roles and ResponsibilitiesTable 3: Roles and ResponsibilitiesGroup Member Roles and Responsibilities AmeyResearch and analysis, MATLAB code development, documentation, project coordination,Report writing. NandeshwarHardware acquisition and integration,MATLAB code development, system testing, troubleshooting. BranoControl algorithm development, MATLAB simulation, Tinkercad simulation, System optimization. ACC Execution ProcedureStep 1: Gather Hardware ComponentsEnsure that you have all the required hardware components for the project:Arduino UnoLCD DisplayUltrasonic SensorPushbuttons (5 buttons)Resistors (as required)Battery and Battery Connector CableJumper WiresPCB or BreadboardPotentiometerStep 2: Prepare Arduino EnvironmentInstall the required libraries for Ultrasonic and LCD display in the Arduino IDE.Connect the Arduino Uno to your computer via USB.Step 3: Arduino Uno & LCD ConnectionsThe following table lists the pin connections between Arduino Uno and the LCD display:Table 4: Arduino Uno & the LCD display ConnectionsLCD PinsArduino Uno PinsVSS (GND)GNDVDD (5V)5VVO (Contrast)Potentiometer Pin (Adjust Contrast)RSD7RW (GND)GNDED6D4D5D5D4D6D3D7D2A (LED+)5VK (LED-)GNDStep 4: Arduino Uno & Ultrasonic Sensor ConnectionsThe following table lists the pin connections between Arduino Uno and the Ultrasonic sensor:Table 5: Arduino Uno & Ultrasonic Sensor ConnectionsUltrasonic Sensor PinsArduino Uno PinsVCC (5V)5VGNDGNDTRIGD10ECHOD8Step 5: Arduino Uno & Pushbuttons ConnectionsThe following table lists the pin connections between Arduino Uno and the pushbuttons:Table 6: Arduino Uno & Pushbuttons ConnectionsPushbuttonArduino Uno PinsIncrease SpeedA0Decrease SpeedA1CancelA2Set SpeedA3Adaptive Cruise ControlA4Step 6: Assemble the CircuitConnect the LCD display to the Arduino Uno as per the table in Step 3.Connect the Ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino Uno as per the table in Step 4.Connect the pushbuttons to the Arduino Uno as per the table in Step 5.Use resistors where necessary to protect components and set up voltage dividers, following the design requirements.Step 7: MATLAB ProgramCopy and paste the MATLAB program provided in the report into the MATLAB environment.
